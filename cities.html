                    The following is a list of the most populous incorporated places of the United States. As defined
                    by the United States Census Bureau, an "incorporated place" includes a variety of designations,
                    including city, town, village, borough, and municipality. A few exceptional Census Designated
                    Places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[2]
                    Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire
                    population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include
                    multiple incorporated places. This list presents only that portion (or "balance") of such
                    consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits;
                    the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately,
                    and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different
                    ranking is evident when considering U.S. metropolitan area populations.

                    Old Dominion pulled off the biggest upset of the season so far, as the 29-point underdogs shocked No. 13 Virginia Tech 49-35. It was the biggest upset by an FBS team over an ACC opponent in the past 40 seasons. C-USA had lost 52 straight games against ranked nonconference opponents. It was also another blow to an already-struggling ACC, as Boston College also lost to Purdue and is likely to fall out of the top 25. Clemson remains the league's lone playoff contender but would benefit most if Miami stays ranked and wins the Coastal. Assuming Clemson wins the Atlantic, it might not face a ranked opponent until the ACC title game. It's SOS will be questioned by the committee, which means little to no margin for error.
