                    The following is a list of the most populous incorporated places of the United States. As defined
                    by the United States Census Bureau, an "incorporated place" includes a variety of designations,
                    including city, town, village, borough, and municipality. A few exceptional Census Designated
                    Places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[2]
                    Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire
                    population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include
                    multiple incorporated places. This list presents only that portion (or "balance") of such
                    consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits;
                    the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately,
                    and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different
                    ranking is evident when considering U.S. metropolitan area populations.
